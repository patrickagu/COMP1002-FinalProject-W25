                <p>AutoRush Retro was born from a shared passion for the golden age of automobiles, those iconic machines of the 20th century that defined a generation. It all started in a small garage in Barrie, Canada, where our founder, Patrick, spent countless nights restoring a 1967 Volkswagen Beetle. That car wasnâ€™t just metal, it was a time capsule, a beautiful story on wheels. Patrickâ€™s love for it sparked a dream: to bring these forgotten treasures back to life and share them with the world.</p>
                <p>Soon, the mission grew into a thriving enterprise. He scoured junkyards, auctions, and dusty garages from Detroit to DÃ¼sseldorf, from Tokyo to Cape Town unearthing classics like the Shelby Cobra, Peugeot 504, and Ford Cortina. Each car they saved carried a unique history. In time, Autorush became more than a dealership; it became a sanctuary for these stories, a place where the past drives back to life.</p>
                <p>Our experiences shaped who we are. We have learned to listen to the engine, to feel the soul of a car through its worn leather seats. Every dent and every polish is a chapter weâ€™re proud to preserve. Today, AutoRush Retro stands as a testament to our love for these vehicles and the people who cherish them as much as we do.</p>
